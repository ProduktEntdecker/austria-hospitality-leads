## 🏪 Customer Deployment Guide

### For Testing (Current Setup)
1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProduktEntdecker/austria-hospitality-leads.git
   cd austria-hospitality-leads
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000/settings
   # Add your API keys securely
   ```

3. **Start System**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Production (Customer Deployment)
1. **Each customer needs their own API keys**
2. **Use Docker deployment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```
3. **Customer accesses `/settings` to configure keys**
4. **Keys are encrypted per deployment**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### API Key Management
```typescript
// Backend: AES-256-GCM encryption
class APIKeyManagerService {
  private encrypt(data: APIKeys): EncryptedKeys
  private decrypt(encryptedData: EncryptedKeys): APIKeys
  async testKey(provider: string, key: string): Promise<boolean>
}

// Frontend: Secure UI with validation
<APIKeyManager />
  - Masked display (first/last 4 chars)
  - Real-time validation
  - Per-provider testing
```

### German SEO Optimization
```typescript
// 2025-ready search terms
OPTIMIZED_GERMAN_SEARCH_TERMS = {
  hotelausstatter: [...],    // 2,100 monthly searches
  regionalModifiers: [...],   // Austrian cities
  qualityIndicators: [...]    // Trust signals
} as const;
```

## ⚠️ Known Technical Debt & Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Frontend Error Handling**: Could be more granular
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Not implemented for key testing
3. **Logging**: Could use structured logging for key operations
4. **Testing**: Need more unit tests for encryption service

### Future Improvements
1. **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation system
2. **Backup/Recovery**: Key backup mechanism
3. **Audit Logging**: Track key usage and changes
4. **Multi-Factor Auth**: For sensitive key operations
